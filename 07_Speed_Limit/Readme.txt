The purpose of these lesson plans are to introduce 1-D finite explicit 
and a recommended assessment for hyperbolic PDEs.

Contents:
07_01 is a notebook explaining the explicit method for the wave equation with two applications

07_02 is a notebook with a wave equation assignment.  The assignment takes 07_01 a step further
and requires the student to hand calculate a new finite difference scheme because the governing
equation has changed.  We are now including a damping term.  The solution portion of the second
notebook is not intended for the student to see, but I wanted to include the solution as a
contribution to the class.
